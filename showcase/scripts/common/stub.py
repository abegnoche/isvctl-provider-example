"""Emit the scaffold result payload every showcase template script produces.

A scaffold script is a placeholder: on a real run it reports that the ISV has
not implemented the step yet, and under ``ISVCTL_DEMO_MODE=1`` it reports the
dummy success that lets ``make demo-test`` exercise the wiring end to end.
Both shapes are the same JSON contract, so they live in one helper here rather
than being restated per script.
