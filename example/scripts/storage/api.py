"""Storage shim template (copy and fill in for your backend).

Each method has a ``TODO`` block - swap in your backend's SDK / REST / CLI
calls and return the appropriate dataclass. The ``ISVCTL_DEMO_MODE=1`` gate
returns dummy data so a demo acceptance run passes end-to-end before the real
backend is wired up (see the demo command in ``README.md``).

The shim subclasses ``Implementation`` and is composed by ``new_implementation()``
in ``build_api()``. You declare identity once as a static ``ProviderProperties``
*core*, then implement ONLY the surfaces your backend serves. Which capabilities
are supported is *detected* from the methods you override; ``new_implementation``
gates everything else. This is the key rule of the detection model:

  **To say "not supported", simply do NOT define the method** - inherit the base.
  Do NOT ship a stub that raises: an overridden method reads as *supported* and
  fails the suite when probed.

The sibling ``config/storage-provider-manifest.yaml`` is the contract the
validation suite probes: every capability it marks ``supported`` must answer,
and a surface you did not implement must be declared ``none``. Keep the two in
sync - detection and the manifest must agree.

Authoring checklist:

  1. Replace the ``_CORE`` identity declaration with your backend's values.
  2. Replace ``MyStorageApi.__init__`` with your backend connection setup.
  3. Fill in ``health_check`` with an authenticated round-trip.
  4. Fill in ``get_tenant_quota`` and ``list_volumes``.
  5. To back a surface your backend offers (volume create/delete, directory- or
     user-quota CRUD, tenant enumeration): ADD the method, declare any L2
     semantics in ``capability_qualifiers()``, and flip the matching manifest
     entry to ``native``. To NOT offer one, leave the method undefined and
     declare it ``none`` (the managed-K8s default is that the CSI driver owns
     volume lifecycle, so ``create_volume`` / ``delete_volume`` are omitted here
     and the suite falls back to ``list_volumes``).
  6. Keep ``config/storage-provider-manifest.yaml`` in sync: every capability it
     marks ``native``/``default`` must be implemented (the suite enforces it).
